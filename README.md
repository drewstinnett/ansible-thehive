# ansible-thehive

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drewstinnett/ansible-thehive.svg?branch=master)

## Description

Deploy an instance of TheHive.  This Ansible script deploys the code from [CERT-BDF](https://github.com/CERT-BDF/TheHive).

**DEPRECATION**: Now that the folks at [CERT-BDF](https://github.com/CERT-BDF/TheHive) have an RPM/DEB package, this ansible module isn't really needed.  Leaving it up a bit longer if folks want to view it for historical reasons.

## Requirements
